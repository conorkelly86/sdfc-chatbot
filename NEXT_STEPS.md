# Next Steps for Football Club Chatbot

## After Docker Build Completes

Once the Docker build completes (which might take some time due to the large dependencies), you can:

1. Start the Docker container:

   ```
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. Enter the container to interact with Rasa:

   ```
   docker-compose exec rasa bash
   ```

3. Inside the container, train the model:

   ```
   rasa train
   ```

4. Start a conversation with your bot:
   ```
   rasa shell
   ```

## Further Development

To enhance your football club chatbot, consider:

1. **Custom Actions**: Create custom actions in a `actions.py` file to integrate with external APIs for real-time match data, player statistics, or ticket availability.

2. **Forms**: Implement forms to collect user information for complex interactions like ticket bookings.

3. **Rich Responses**: Add image URLs, buttons, or other rich content to make responses more engaging.

4. **Entity Recognition Improvements**: Add more training examples with entity annotations to improve entity recognition.

5. **Integration with Messaging Platforms**: Configure the bot to work with platforms like Facebook Messenger, Slack, or WhatsApp.

## Project Structure

The project is already set up with:

- `config.yml`: NLU and Core configuration
- `domain.yml`: Domain definition with intents, entities, slots, and responses
- `data/nlu/nlu.yml`: Training data for NLU
- `data/stories/stories.yml`: Training stories for conversation flows
- `data/rules/rules.yml`: Rules for specific conversation patterns
- `endpoints.yml`: Configuration for connecting to external endpoints

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Docker Build Fails**: Check Docker logs for detailed error messages.
2. **Training Errors**: Validate YAML syntax and ensure intents in stories exist in the domain.
3. **Memory Issues**: Adjust Docker container memory allocation in `docker-compose.yml` if needed.
